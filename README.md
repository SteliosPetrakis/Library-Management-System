Library-Management-System

This is a basic Library Management System. It was created using Java Swing in Netbeans 8.2 and also with the help of MySQL 5.5 Command Line Client. 
It uses two tools which this version of Netbeans doesn't have:

1. jcalendar: This is for the issueBook, to arrange the issue and due dates.
2. rs2xml: This is is used to display the data in a table format.

This project was made with the help of a YouTube video series. I followed this guide making improvements and modifications. It was a simple and easy to understand way to make this project.
The code provided by the original source had its mistakes, mostly in the SQL code mentioned in the classes themesleves.
It mostly needed capitalization in order to work.

I made this project in order to gain knowledge, practice and help people with similar or even the exact same project.

Here's the link to the Video Series mentioned if you want to do it from the beginning by yourself: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdw3bwfvRM&list=PLdRq0mbeEBmwUyZNJsmkBjQeIneme6HCz

Make sure to download the jar files and images from here since the sources to download them mentioned in the series aren't exactly safe and its just easier (you can trust me).

Thank you for reading this, have a wonderful day!
